## Developing Steps

### download bootstrap theme
I tried to find a well design html theme and download a theme called "logis"

Then modified most the pages and include the dynamic menu.

### Create a dynamic Menu to incldude in all pages easily
I followed the course of listing items from data json data, then I could modified the existing menu to be in a JavaScript file, then could include easily in each page I included in this project.

When I need to change the menu, Im doing that in one file then all pages will take the effects.

This is the same for footer, that both are dynamic.
